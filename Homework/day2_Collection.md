### Comparator, Comparable
1. Comparable
- java.lang.Comparable interface
- inside comparing, a comparable object is capable of comparing itself with another object, The class itself must implement Comprable interface to compare its object
- override the compareTo method
- we can customize only one sorting rule for the same class

2. Comparator
- java.util.Comparator interface
- external comparing, Comparator is external to the object type we are comparing. Itâ€™s a separate class. We create multiple separate classes (that implement Comparator) to compare by different members, anonymous class works as well.
- override the compare method
- has @FunctionalInterface annotation, so we can override compare method in the lambda expression
- we can customize more sorting rule by create multiple class that implements Comparator Interface
