### primitive data types
- byte: A data type that can hold 8-bit data values
- short: A data type that can hold a 16-bit integer 
- int: A data type that can hold a 32-bit signed integer 
- long: A data type that can hold a 64-bit signed integer 
- float: A data type that holds a 32-bit floating-point number 
- double: A data type that holds a 64-bit floating-point number 
- char: A data type that can hold unsigned 16-bit Unicode characters
- boolean: A data type that can hold True and False values only 

### flow control
- if: Tests a true/false expression and branches accordingly
- else: Indicates alternative branches in an if statement 
- switch: A statement that executes code based on a test value 
- case: Used in switch statements to mark blocks of text
- default: Specifies the default block of code in a switch statement
- for: Used to start a for loop
- do: Starts a do-while loop
- while: Starts a while loop
- break: A control statement for breaking out of loops.
- continue: Sends control back outside a loop 
- return: Sends control and possibly a return value back from a called method 

### modifiers
- public: An access specifier used for classes, interfaces, methods, and variables indicating that an item is accessible throughout the application (or where the class that defines it is accessible)
- private: An access specifier indicating that a method or variable may be accessed only in the class it’s declared in
- protected: An access specifier indicating that a method or variable may only be accessed in the class it’s declared in (or a subclass of the class it’s declared in or other classes in the same package)
- static: Indicates that a variable or method is a class method (rather than being limited to one particular object)
- final: Indicates that a variable holds a constant value or that a method will not be overridden
- abstract: Specifies that a class or method will be implemented later, in a subclass 
- synchronized: Specifies critical sections or methods in multithreaded code
- native: Specifies that a method is implemented with native (platform-specific) code 
- strictfp: A Java keyword is used to restrict the precision and rounding of floating-point calculations to ensure portability
- transient: Specifies that a variable is not part of an object’s persistent state
- volatile: This indicates that a variable may change asynchronously
